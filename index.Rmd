I am a doctoral researcher with broad interests in **evolutionary biology and animal behaviour**.
I work on **population genomics and single cell brain epigenomics** to understand how population-typical phenotypes of **seasonal migration** evolved in a songbird species, blackcap (*Sylvia atricapilla*).
