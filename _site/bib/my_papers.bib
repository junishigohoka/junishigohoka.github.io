	abstract = {The patterns of genetic relatedness among individuals vary along the genome, representing fluctuation of local ancestry. The factors responsible for this variation have not been well studied in wild animals with ecological and behavioural relevance. Here, we characterise the genomic architecture of genetic relatedness in the Eurasian blackcap, an iconic songbird species in ecology and quantitative genetics of migratory behaviour. We identify 23 genomic regions with deviated local relatedness patterns, using a chromosome-level de novo assembly of the blackcap genome and whole-genome resequencing data of 179 individuals from nine populations with diverse migratory phenotypes. Five genomic regions show local relatedness patterns of polymorphic inversions, three of which are syntenic to polymorphic inversions known in the zebra finch. Phylogenetic analysis reveals these three polymorphic inversions evolved independently in the blackcap and zebra finch indicating convergence of polymorphic inversions. Population genetic analyses in these three inversions in the blackcap suggest balancing selection between two haplotypes in one locus and background selection in the other two loci. One genomic region with deviated local relatedness is under selection against gene flow by population-specific reduction in recombination rate. Other genomic islands including 11 pericentromeric regions consist of evolutionarily conserved and non-conserved recombination cold-spots under background selection. Two of these regions with non-conserved recombination suppression are known to be associated with population-specific migratory phenotypes, where local relatedness patterns support additional effects of population-specific selection. These results highlight how different forms of recombination suppression and selection jointly affect heterogeneous genomic landscape of local ancestries.},

	abstract = {Recombination generates new combination of alleles, whereby it maintains
haplotype diversity and enhances the efficacy of selection. Despite the
apparent stasis in positioning recombination events in birds,
recombination rates differ widely across the genome and within species.
The causes of recombination rate variation and its evolutionary impact
on natural populations remain poorly understood. We used whole-genome
resequencing data of 167 individuals of the Eurasian blackcap (Sylvia
atricapilla) to characterise the historical recombination landscape
variation at broad and fine scales among populations with distinct
migratory phenotypes. We additionally evaluated the interplay between
recombination rates with patterns of genetic diversity, population
divergence (based on Fst and dxy), and potential signs of selection. Our
comparative analyses revealed: i) Lower divergence of recombination maps
at the broad scale and higher variability at fine scales. Resident
island populations showed higher variability in recombination patterns
among them and with continental populations. Recombination rates were
more conserved in continental populations regardless of the migratory
phenotype. ii) The degree of divergence between recombination maps
correlated with population differentiation. It could also recapitulate
population-specific demographic history and genetic structure. iii)
Recombination rates correlated negatively with Fst and positively with
nucleotide diversity and dxy, suggesting that recombination may reduce
the effect of linked selection over the loss of neutral diversity. We
identified chromosomal regions with potential signs of linked selection.
This study evidences that recombination is a variable trait that shapes
the diversity and evolution of population differentiation in the
blackcap.},

	abstract = {Seasonal migration is a taxonomically widespread behaviour that integrates across many traits. The European blackcap exhibits enormous variation in migration and is renowned for research on its evolution and genetic basis. We assembled a reference genome for blackcaps and obtained whole genome resequencing data from individuals across its breeding range. Analyses of population structure and demography suggested divergence began {\textasciitilde}30,000 ya, with evidence for one admixture event between migrant and resident continent birds {\textasciitilde}5000 ya. The propensity to migrate, orientation and distance of migration all map to a small number of genomic regions that do not overlap with results from other species, suggesting that there are multiple ways to generate variation in migration. Strongly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were located in regulatory regions of candidate genes that may serve as major regulators of the migratory syndrome. Evidence for selection on shared variation was documented, providing a mechanism by which rapid changes may evolve.},

	abstract = {Thyroid hormones are closely linked to the hatching process in precocial birds. Previously, we showed that thyroid hormones in brain had a strong impact on filial imprinting, an early learning behavior in newly hatched chicks; brain 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine (T3) peaks around hatching and imprinting training induces additional T3 release, thus, extending the sensitive period for imprinting and enabling subsequent other learning. On the other hand, blood thyroid hormone levels have been reported to increase gradually after hatching in altricial species, but it remains unknown how the brain thyroid hormone levels change during post-hatching development of altricial birds. Here, we determined the changes in serum and brain thyroid hormone levels of a passerine songbird species, the zebra finch using radioimmunoassay. In the serum, we found a gradual increase in thyroid hormone levels during post-hatching development, as well as differences between male and female finches. In the brain, there was clear surge in the hormone levels during development in males and females coinciding with the time of fledging, but the onset of the surge of thyroxine (T4) in males preceded that of females, whereas the onset of the surge of T3 in males succeeded that of females. These findings provide a basis for understanding the functions of thyroid hormones during early development and learning in altricial birds.},
